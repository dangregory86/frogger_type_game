#Get your person to the water game#
=================================

This simple arcade game takes it's inspiration from the classic frogger. The aim of the game is to get your character to the
far side of the track to the water.

##Instructions##
============
First you need to load index.html into your favourite browser.
You will then be presented with a modal where you can select your character.
Once you've selected click start and the game will begin.
You then use the arrow keys to control your character's movement being sure to dodge the bugs.

The more people you save the harder the game gets so beware!!

Last of all, enjoy.
